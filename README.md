TITLE:- FAKE COIN PROBLEM 

 

ALGORITHM: 

The algorithm can be explained through by first partitioning then optimizing it by implementing through a main function: 

Step 1: Define a function to partition the luggage into smaller compartments recursively until a manageable size is reached. 

Step 2: Implement a partitioning strategy based on factors such as item density, material composition, and threat likelihood. 

Step 3: Recursively divide each compartment until a manageable size is reached. 

Step 4: Return a list of partitions representing the smaller compartments for further inspection. 

Step 5: Define a function to optimize the inspection process within each partition using dynamic programming techniques. 

Step 6: Define a DP table to store optimal solutions for subproblems within the partition. 

Step 7: Initialize the DP table with base cases. 

Step 8: Use recursion or iteration to compute optimal solutions for larger subproblems within the partition. 

Step 9: Update the DP table and make decisions based on optimal solutions to maximize threat detection effectiveness while minimizing resource utilization. 

Step 10: Return the number of threats detected in the partition. 

Step 11: Define a main function to initiate the security check optimization process.  

Step 12: Load luggage items for screening using a function. 

Step 13: Call the optimize function to optimize threat detection effectiveness across all luggage compartments. 

Step 14: Print the total number of threats detected after optimization. 

 

 

Combining Divide and Conquer (D&C) with Dynamic Programming (DP) for security checks, using the fake coin problem as an analogy, can provide a comprehensive approach to efficiently and effectively detect threats or prohibited items concealed within luggage. 

  

1. Divide and Conquer: 

Partitioning Luggage: Divide the luggage into smaller subsets or compartments for systematic inspection. This partitioning can be based on factors such as item density, size, or material composition. 

Recursive Inspection: Apply recursive inspection within each partition, breaking down the inspection process into smaller, more manageable tasks. For example, inspecting individual compartments or layers within the luggage. 

Threat Detection: Identify suspicious items or anomalies within each partition through visual inspection, X-ray imaging, or other screening technologies. Focus on detecting potential threats or prohibited items concealed within the luggage. 

 

2) Dynamic Programming 

 

Optimization of Inspection: Utilize dynamic programming techniques to optimize the inspection process within each partition. Determine the most efficient sequence of inspection steps or strategies for detecting threats while minimizing false positives and false negatives. 

Weighted Decision Making: Assign weights or scores to different inspection strategies based on factors such as threat likelihood, detection accuracy, and resource utilization. Use dynamic programming to select the optimal combination of strategies that maximizes threat detection effectiveness within each partition. 

Adaptive Inspection: Continuously adapt and refine the inspection process based on feedback from previous inspections, evolving threat profiles, and operational constraints. Dynamic programming enables adaptive decision-making to optimize security checks in real-time.
